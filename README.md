# Auto-Tetris-Player
Idk how to play Tetris well so i made a script that will do it for me

20/3/25: Still in a work of progress. Currently it works but only if you play tetris sideways (it solves it vertically idk why). Will fix the logic when I am free, or anyone wants to help me fix it I'll be happy
